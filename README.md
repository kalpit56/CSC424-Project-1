# CSC424-Project-1
This is a simple project where I established a client server relationship for my Computer Networks course. 
The instructions can be found in the pdf file within the repo.

## Running the code
In order to run the code, you need to download the files and simply compile them and run them. 

## Usage
./client_template [ID]

The ID is supposed to be our CaneID, which is an 8 digit number. For testing purposes, you can use any sequence of numbers.
